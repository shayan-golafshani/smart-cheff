## Project summary

SmartCheff is an app that allows the user to input any amount of ingredients manually or with the camera if the ingredient has a barcode. After the user has inputted the ingredients of their choice and selected the search button, recipes are presented that include the ingredients inputted.
Picture being a student with the classic ingredient Top Ramen. When Top Ramen is selected as an ingredient SmartCheff will display all the delicious ways to cook your Top Ramen.
* Recipe lookup: When a user inputs the ingredients, the app will generate a list of recipes that include the selected ingredients.
* The use of the users' camera: The camera will be used to input products as an ingredient by scanning the barcode of a product.
* Ability to save recipes and ingredients used.
