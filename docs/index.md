## Project introduction & description:

SmartCheff is an app that allows the user to input any amount of ingredients manually or with the camera if the ingredient has a barcode. After the user has imputed the ingredients of their choice and selected the search button, recipes are presented that include the ingredients inputted.
Picture being a student with the classic ingredient Top Ramen. When Top Ramen is selected as an ingredient SmartCheff will display all the delicious ways to cook your Top Ramen.

The motivation behind creating this application stems from the same reason I decided to pursue a career in application development.
Simply put, I want to provide opportunity for the people I care about, starting with my lovely girlfriend of four years Emily.
Emily is an inspiring cook who one day wants to have a career in culinary arts. That's why I chose to create a recipe application its something close to my heart and has helped me stay excited and motivated through my first steps into application development.
 
The intended functional elements in this project include recipe lookup by ingredient, the use of the users' camera to input an ingredient via barcode, and the ability to save or bookmark recipes for future use.
